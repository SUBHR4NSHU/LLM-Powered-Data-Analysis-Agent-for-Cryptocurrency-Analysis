Bitcoin's issuance is capped at 21 million coins, with a current circulating supply of approximately 19.9 million BTC as of October 2025. The block reward for miners is currently ₿3.125, halved approximately every four years. Bitcoin is recognized for its floating exchange rate and is actively developed as open-source software.

            "3. **Quantization**: Reduce the precision of model weights and activations from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit or 16-bit integers, which can speed up computations.\n",

            "The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments, with some assets showing signs of recovery while others continue to struggle. Key highlights from the news analyst's report include the recent regulatory developments in the US, which have sparked concerns among investors, as well as the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in emerging markets. On the price analyst's side, historical data suggests that the market is due for a correction, with many assets trading at overbought levels. However, the analyst also notes that the market has shown resilience in the face of adversity, with some assets experiencing significant price increases despite the overall bearish trend. Considering these factors, I predict that the cryptocurrency market will experience a moderate correction in the short term, with prices potentially dropping by 10-20% before stabilizing. In the long term, I expect the market to continue its upward trend, driven by growing adoption and increasing institutional investment. Key assets to watch include Bitcoin, which is likely to break through the $40,000 resistance level, and Ethereum, which may experience a significant price increase due to its growing use cases and adoption. Overall, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile and unpredictable, but with careful analysis and consideration of multiple factors, investors can make informed decisions and potentially reap significant rewards.\u001b[0m\n",
